In the following paper, a system is presented, which shall improve parking lot
surveillance and management. To make sure that this solution can be used
individually on every kind of parking lot, there will be developed two
independent modules, one for license plate detection and one for vehicle
detection. These modules shall be able to send their data to a database, which
can be accessed and controlled via an intuitive web application. With the
license plate detection, it shall be possible to identify each vehicle and watch
their status on the parking lot. The vehicle detection detects the status of
each parking spot and therefore it can be monitored which parking spot is
currently taken and which is free to be used. These data are visualized in the
web application, which offers extensive display options as well as different
user interfaces for parking lot owners and customers. Through its modular
structure, the system can provide great service for company parking lots and
public parking lots of any size.
